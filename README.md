The repository contains 5 CSV files, two plain text codes, and two ipynb files with the code for Jupyter notebook. Each file represents the dataset that was used for data analysis in the study. To run the code, you need to download each file and then run a code on your PC through an application applicable to Python e.g., Jupyter Notebook. Please, don't forget to change the file path in the code before running it.
